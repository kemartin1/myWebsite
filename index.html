            	<h2>RPHL</h2>
            	<p>Welcome to the Redford Premier Hockey League. RPHL has been around since 2010 featuring some of the best hockey players in the area.
            	    Formally known as CPHL, after a change of ownership, the league was quickly taken in a new direction and given the new name.
            	    RPHL has since taken off as one of the most prestigious leagues around. </p>
            	<p>We feature games every Wednesday night, at the Redford Ice Arena, with fierce, battling competition. As playoffs are near, you will need to pick up your tickets soon as they will not last long.
            		We hope to see you there, and enjoy the games!</p>
